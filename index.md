## On Learning to Draw

In this blog, I will be documenting my drawing journey. Along the way, I will create my own learning path based on my ultimate goal: becoming fluent in the visual creation of new, imaginative worlds.

This is a tailored learning path strongly focused on the basics of physical matter: line, shape, texture, material, and light. The rest is about creativity and magical realism. There is only one rule here: never to draw direct imitations of the real world—though, of course, leaving room to be inspired by it.

Let’s see how it goes. You are invited to come aboard.
