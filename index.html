  <h2>On Learning to Draw</h2>
  <p>In this blog, I will be documenting my drawing journey. Along the way, I will create my own learning path based on my ultimate goal: becoming fluent in the visual creation of new, imaginative worlds.</p>
  <p>This is a tailored learning path strongly focused on the basics of physical matter: line, shape, texture, material, and light. The rest is about creativity and magical realism. There is only one rule here: never to draw imitations of the real world... though, of course, leaving room to be inspired by it.</p>
  <p>Let’s see how it goes. You are invited to come aboard.</p>
