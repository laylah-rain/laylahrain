TITLE: The matryoshka doll narrative technique
DESCRIPTION: A guide for writers

# The matryoshka doll
Narrative technique

Similar to the process of opening a matryoshka doll where dolls nested inside each other are discovered, this narrative technique orders the story starting from an outer layer and ending in the innermost one: a layer-by-layer zoom in.

About the technique:

- Each layer is connected to the surrounding layers by a relationship of depth or detail.
- The middle layers have to be interesting on their own.
- The last layer is more interesting than the rest to reward the reader for reaching the end.


## Film example

The following video is part of the opening of *Hugo*, a movie released in 2011:

Layers of the previous scene:

- Paris
- Trains arriving at the train station
- The platform of the train station
- The interior of the train station
- The train station clock
- **Reward**: A child inside the clock.


## Literary example

> On the sand of the beach were the bones of a whale. Entering through the barvas curtain above the jaw and following the shadow formed by the spine of the body was halfway the still beating heart that resisted death: the strength of the sea still born from within.

Layers of the previous text:

- The beach
- A whale skeleton
- The mouth of the whale skeleton
- The spine of the whale skeleton
- **Reward**: The whale's heart still beating.
